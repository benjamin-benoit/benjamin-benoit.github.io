          My journey in the world of development began with the passion that has
          driven me since my high school years: manga. I embarked on creating a
          website back then, even though it was quite basic. The importance of
          creativity and the idea of providing a pleasant user experience have
          always been at the core of my concerns.

        <span className="story-text">
          My initial forays into the web domain occurred during my first two
          internships, but I quickly discovered mobile app development, which
          turned out to be my first significant experience. Subsequently, I had
          the opportunity to delve into the realms of React JS and React Native
          during my final years of studies, and I was completely captivated.
          Naturally, I directed my professional path towards roles that allowed
          me to continue evolving in these technologies.
